 5 things about this website

  - In this minigame there is one political person and one political partie hidden.
  - In the previous version of this website I spend quite some time creating icons for the
   different countries. Now there is no use for it anymore but if you like you can copy paste
   them for free from here: u
   - There is a data policy section to see which crazy things happen with ur data:
