# modes-media.de 
Vue/Typescript code for my website [modes-media.de](https://modes-media.de)

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

This repo doesn't contain the photographs you can see on the website. If you want to try the code, you can add example images like this: 

In `src/photography-content` create a folder `photography` and add your test images to it. 
In `src/photography-content/index.ts` you can overwrite the existing images paths with the paths to the images you just added.
